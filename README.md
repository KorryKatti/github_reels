github reels — scrollable AI-powered previews of github repos, narrated with TTS and rendered with math-based canvas animations.

- shows 10 reels at a time
- add your own username to fetch your repos
- resets db when full — no warning
- inspired by [this cursed tweet](https://x.com/zeroxjackson/status/1929061221652902188)

this project runs on duct tape, caffeine, and a tiny VPS.
